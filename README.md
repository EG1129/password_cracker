Set of projects designed for CMPT 471-Parallel computing using CUDA and MPi to improve performance

includes:
Password cracker designed serially with c++ and then parallely with MPI. Overall results indicate that using MPI and 4 cores improves performance by about 3.5x.

Parallelization of Dijkstra algorithm using CUDA. The CUDA version achieved a 1.5× speedup over the serial implementation, reducing execution time from 600 ms to 400 ms. This represents a 50% performance improvement.”
